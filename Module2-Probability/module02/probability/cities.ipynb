    "# Probability and Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it may turn out that you cannot easily describe your problem analytically or enumerate all the possibilities in which case you can turn to simulation to do you event generation and counting, to get the probabilities you're interested in. Here's an example that actually happened to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cities\n",

    "Some data scientists are involved in personalization at online retailers. They apply personalization models to different views of the products whether they are sales emails or on the website; anywhere there are default lists of products. Of course, not being content to rest on their laurels, these data scientists are constantly developing new personalization models. In order to test whether a new model is better than an old model, they engage in A/B testing. We'll talk about A/B testing later in the book but for now, A/B testing just means dividing your, ahem, test subjects into two groups *completely at random*. Group A will get the *control* or existing personalization model. Group B will get the *treatment* or new personalization model. That sets up the context for the following problem in computational probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are one of those data scientists and have a personalization model that is being tested in 20 cities nationwide. Each city has 100,000 customers on the mailing list and you send an email every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test has been running a few days and it looks like the new model (called the \"treatment\") is about 10% better than the current practice (\"control\"). Let us assume this is true (we'll see later how to test this). After another week of testing, the director of marketing comes to you and is concerned that the new model has done very poorly in one of the cities 3 days in a row and opines that it must not really be 10% better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the director of marketing right? Does this mean the new model is worse than the current one? Maybe, maybe not. Deciding which model is better is a problem in inference. This isn't really what the director of marketing is asserting, though. They're asserting that the new model can't be better if there is a losing streak of 3 days in one city. Now this *is* a question we can answer now, using computational probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want to know--what the stakeholder needs to know--is, if the new model is definitely 10% better, what is the probability of seeing a string of 3 *worse* outcomes in a particular city? If the probability is high, then we needn't worry. If the probability is low, we might be concerned about test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do we know?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 20 cities\n",
    "* Each city has 100,000 subscribers with the lists split in half for control and treatment.\n",
    "* the purchase rate for control is 0.0001 (0.01%)\n",

    "* the lift is 0.011/0.010 = 1.1 - 1.0 = 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "These probably seem small but daily purchase rates are often small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start out by simulating a single day's worth of purchases in a single city. We know what the ideal purchase rate is, but it's not going to pan out to be the same exact thing everyday. We need to simulate those purchases and calculate the actual purchase rate:"
