    "Some of these problems are just calculations, either by hand or by computer. Others involve answering questions with simulations in order to calculate probabilities. You may be called upon to do something similar as a data scientist. For example, you have just fielded an advertising campaign in 20 major cities. Testing showed that advertising campaign was 10 percent better than the previous one. However, the last three weeks of returns in New York have been below average. What is the probability of this happening given that the campaign really is 10 percent better?"

    "\n",
    "Consider the following problems: we have a family with two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability that they are both girls?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we have have to make some assumptions about the probability of a child being either a boy or girl (which we will take to mean either XX or XY chromosomes). The generally accepted probabilities are P(boy) = 0.5 and P(girl) = 0.5 (ignoring other chromosomal possibilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our definition of independence. Two sets of events, $A$ and $B$, are independent if the following holds true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A, B) = P(A)P(B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "but that's how we determine that A and B are independent. If we *assume* that the events are independent, then we can turn it around to calculate the probability of the joint event:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A)P(B) = P(A, B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $A$ is the \"sex of the first child\" and $B$ is the \"sex of the second child\". This means we can take P(A=girl) as 0.5 and P(B=girl) as 0.5--shortened to P(girl) x P(girl)-- which equals 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we wanted to calculate the probability of them being different sexes, then we'd have to calculate the probability of having a boy then a girl (0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25) and the probability of having a girl then a boy (0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25) and combine them based on the Additive Law of Probability: 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.50.\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember how I said probability is just counting?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 possibilities:\n",

    "1. Boy, Girl.\n",
    "2. Girl, Boy.\n",
    "3. Girl, Girl.\n",
    "4. Boy, Boy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one way in which both children are girls so the probability of two girls is 1/4 = 0.25. There are two ways in which the children are mixed sexes so the probability of that joint event is 2/4 = 1/2 = 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability that they are both girls given that at least one is a girl?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are only 3 possibilities--the ones that include a Girl as either the first or the second birth:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Boy, Girl.\n",
    "2. Girl, Boy.\n",
    "3. Girl, Girl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the counting method, we can see that there is only one way to get the result we're interested in and three possible outcomes so the probability is 1/3.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Boy, Girl = 1/4\n",
    "2. Girl, Boy. = 1/4\n",
    "3. Girl, Girl. = 1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we have ruled out the {Boy, Boy} possibility by assumption, we have to renormalize the probabilities. Normalization just means \"make all the probabilities add up to 1 again\" and  you do this by adding the probabilities together (which is 3/4) and dividing each original probability by this *normalizer*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Boy, Girl = 1/4 // 3/4 = 1/3\n",
    "2. Girl, Boy. = 1/4 // 3/4 = 1/3\n",
    "3. Girl, Girl. = 1/4 // 3/4 = 1/3\n",
    "\n",
    "And we get 1/3 as before. The reason we show both ways to get the answer is because, as you might expect, there are cases--most cases--where the counting approach isn't tractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability that they are both girls given that the oldest (first) is a girl?\n",
    "\n",
    "We do the same thing again except that any outcome that has a Boy as the oldest is removed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Girl, Boy. = 1/4\n",
    "2. Girl, Girl. = 1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "And again, we need to have our probabilities add up to 1 so we normalize them:\n",

    "1. Girl, Boy. = 1/4 // 2/4 = 1/2\n",
    "2. Girl, Girl. = 1/4 // 2/4 = 1/2\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it a second, this makes perfect sense...the events are independent so knowing that the first is a girl doesn't give us any information about the second child's sex.\n",
