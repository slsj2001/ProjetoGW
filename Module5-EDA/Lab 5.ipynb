    "## Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Failure to follow the directions will result in a \"0\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The due dates for each are indicated in the Syllabus and the course calendar. If anything is unclear, please email EN605.448@gmail.com the official email for the course or ask questions in the Lab discussion area on Blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Labs also present technical material that augments the lectures and \"book\".  You should read through the entire lab at the start of each module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You will be submitting your assignment to Blackboard. If there are no accompanying files, you should submit *only* your notebook and it should be named using *only* your JHED id: fsmith79.ipynb for example if your JHED id were \"fsmith79\". If the assignment requires additional files, you should name the *folder/directory* your JHED id and put all items in that folder/directory, ZIP it up (only ZIP...no other compression), and submit it to Blackboard.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * do **not** use absolute paths in your notebooks. All resources should appear in the same directory as the rest of your assignments.\n",
    "    * the directory **must** be named your JHED id and **only** your JHED id.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Data Science is as much about what you write (communicating) as the code you execute (researching). In many places, you will be required to execute code and discuss both the purpose and the result. Additionally, Data Science is about reproducibility and transparency. This includes good communication with your team and possibly with yourself. Therefore, you must show **all** work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Avail yourself of the Markdown/Codecell nature of the notebook. If you don't know about Markdown, look it up. Your notebooks should not look like ransom notes. Don't make everything bold. Clearly indicate what question you are answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Submit a cleanly executed notebook. It should say `In [1]` for the first codecell and increase by 1 throughout."

    "\n",
    "In this Module, we partitioned the problem of EDA using a taxonomy with the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Type**: Numerical or Categorical.\n",
    "* **Number of Variables**: 1 or many.\n",
    "* **Technique**: descriptive statistics, tables or charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "we will skip \"goal\" for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we came up with a general set of tools for analyzing data, not all of them applicable to all the cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "* Frequency Table (absolute and relative)\n",
    "* Histograms\n",
    "* Boxplots Plot\n",
    "* Bar chart\n",
    "* Dot chart\n",
    "* Heat map\n",
    "* Scatter Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not exhaust all the chart types, though. We also have the following basic chart types that we talked about in the Visualization Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Points\n",
    "* Lines\n",
    "* Lines and points\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for this lab is to get you acquainted with most of these tools by analyzing a real data set. Follow the general directions in this Module for *methodical* EDA including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Variable Exploration.\n",
    "2. Correlation or Problem driven Exploration of Pairwise Relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we don't really have a problem or question here, we may have to be exhaustive. There are 21 comparisons possible, start with any 5 of them and then use what you discover to add 5 more.\n",
    "\n",
    "And for each case, try different visualizations. What does a histogram tell you that a box-and-whiskers plot does not and vice versa? What about different bin sizes? And the most important bit: you must write something for every single chart you produce. The emphasis here is on *science*. At every juncture, you must say:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why am I trying this?** \"I'm going to look at this data using a box and whiskers plot to explore its general shape.\" \"I am trying more bins to see if the histogram reveals any interesting characteristics.\"\n",
    "2. **Do it.**\n",
    "3. **What did I learn?** \"Although I know the data is generated from a normal distribution, it doesn't look normally distributed. The sample mean is X while the true mean is Y.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In EDA, you should generally never just *change* anything. You should copy your code, explain why you're making some change to the parameters, make the change and then note what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be inventive and creative."
