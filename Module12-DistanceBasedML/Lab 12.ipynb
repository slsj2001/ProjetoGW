    "1. Show all work/steps/calculations. If it is easier to write it out by hand, do so and submit a scanned PDF in addition to this notebook. Otherwise, generate a Markdown cell for each answer.\n",
    "2. You must submit to **two** places by the deadline:\n",
    "    1. In the Lab section of the Course Module where you downloaded this file from, and\n",
    "    2. In your Lab Discussion Group, in the forum for the appropriate Module.\n",
    "3. You may use any core Python libraries or Numpy/Scipy. **Additionally, code from the Module notebooks and lectures is fair to use and modify.** You may also consult Stackoverflow (SO). If you use something from SO, please place a comment with the URL to document the code."
